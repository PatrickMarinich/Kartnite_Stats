After a fantastic championship with two rounds and crazy battles pat was able to come out on top and take home his second ring. With the chip concluded and some time passing it is time to start SEASON 9

Pat comes out to an ice cold start to the season getting brutally shut out of any GP wins tonight, demitri and special guest kevin stole the show. with a strong 3 GP wins from kevin and demitri taking one of his own its clear that pat and chris have some work to do.

great playing as always, hopefully we can get in some more good kart races soon!
