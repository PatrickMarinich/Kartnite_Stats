Another good kart session in LB, chris's place was SPOOKY. 3 GPs played tn, demitri won the first and I won the second 2. chris almost came out of retierment today getting second on GPs 1&2 but fell short. he did save the day by ruining my second 120 look, 0/2 on getting to the last race... maybe next time...

Kart CHIP soon, we have to finalize a date, probably in the next couple of weeks
