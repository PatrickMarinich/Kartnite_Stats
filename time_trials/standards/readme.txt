The other text files in this directory (nsc1.txt,nsc2.txt,nsc3.txt,sc1.txt,sc2.txt,sc3.txt) come directly from the mario kart wii players page. These files contain the 'time trial standard times' and their corresponding ranks. These times and ranks were gathered by copying and pasting the times from the tables on the website. For each category, there are 3 subtables, each subtable is listed in its own file. The goal of create_standards.py is to convert the copy/pasted text into a usable python dictonary for getting the ranks of our PBs.
