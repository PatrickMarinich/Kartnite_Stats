# Kartnite_Stats

## General Info 
Version 4.0, automation work
Dec 2021 -> Current

**Background:** My friends and I have been massive fans of the Mario Kart Wii game for years now. We tend to get into friendly arguments about who is the best both overall and on any given race. After these debates happened one of my friends created an excel spreadsheet to hold our race data so that we can compare our overall stats with one another to determine who is the best. The issue that we found very quickly was that it was slow and tedious to enter in and calculate all of the different things that we wanted to see. Thus the idea for a Python script of *Kartnite Stats* was born. 

**Goal:** This scripts goal is to take user inputted *Mario Kart Wii* races and other stats and save them to be used for calculations and analysis when user requested. 

# Notes
All File paths are now relative to their respective locations witin the file tree, so if files are moved around these have to be changed. It also means that if you are running the 
code in vscode or another IDE, then the current directory must be set to where the main function lives so that file paths are correct.
