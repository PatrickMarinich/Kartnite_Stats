# Kartnite_Stats
A place to store the code for the mario kart stats project.

# Notes
All File paths are now relative to their respective locations witin the file tree, so if files are moved around these have to be changed. It also means that if you are running the 
code in vscode or another IDE, then the current directory must be set to where the main function lives so that file paths are correct.
