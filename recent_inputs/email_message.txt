season 8 is now officially underway! Season 7 was the best to date hopefully season 8 shapes out the same way. 3 GPs today since we took a break to watch basketball halfway through

I robbed chris of a win in GP3 thats for sure, hes still the only person to get blued 3 times in a race, for now a total of 6 races since we have been keeping track. 

great playing outside, hopefully theres more of that this summer!

season 7 awards are up to date, the pdf for the chip is under construction
