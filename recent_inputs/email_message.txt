last kart with kevin in awhile since the kid goes back to school. we had some CLOSE GPS tonight between kev and I. 
demitri played two then mike popped out and played 2 as well. joe ALMOST WON he was popping off on the dolphin dasher. 

it was great plays while kevin was here, sadly he might be demoted to "special guest" at this point :(. 

more kart soon!! hopefully back to mondays
