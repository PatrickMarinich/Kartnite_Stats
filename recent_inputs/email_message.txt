Another MKM in the BOOOKS. LONG BRANCH KART

Danny popped out again this week and looked to beat chris' low score of the night but fell pretty short. 
4 GPS down tonight with demitri taking 2, Pat taking 1 and chris taking 1

there were some insane races especially GP 3 where everybody but demitri finished a race under 4th, thought chris won this gp giving him another comeback win

more kart soon!!
