A fine mario kart tuesday this week. we had a CLOSE CALL on a 120. pat had 105 going into the last race and lost to a photo finish on LC. Couldn't have drawn up better. the run was almost killed by a COM as well on SGB lol. 

mike may have had is worst day yet, chris told him to take a long look in the mirror. Chris was also doing cardio all night smh. 

joe was literally sweating paste it was insane, hes lucky we didnt play rainbow.
