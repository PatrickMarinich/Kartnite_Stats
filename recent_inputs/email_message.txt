Unfortunetly I missed this past kart session, thanks to demitri for keeping the stats

It looks like kevin can still hang with the big dogs even after being away, demitris dominance after learning delay drifting is still clear. chris and mike bros you gotta get it together......

i probably missed some funny moments but ill be back for next kart session.
