Another MKM in the books, were getting close to the end of the season only about 2 months away. good plays everybody, always a good time when we get the whole squad out to chill (except sick joe). 

Im thinking of trying to get a discord bot set up, I just need to find a few spare hours to work on it..... too much going on. 
if you guys have any ideas let me know

hyped for next kart sesh, I finally broke the losing streak. Mike had another shot to get 3rd today super close down to the last race.
