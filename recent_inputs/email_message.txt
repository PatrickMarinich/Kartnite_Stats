chris came out HOT today winning 2/3 GPs on this fine MKM. Mike also put up a solid performance, first two GPs he had some solid looks to win a GP yet again. 

danny popped out again, lots of 4th places, and even took a few first place blues. hes improving fast

another great MKM in the books. hopefully more soon
