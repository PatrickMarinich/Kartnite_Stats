a full house mario kart monday to close out september 2025. had some football on in the background as well. demitri pulls out 2 GP wins and Pat takes the other two. I almost had a 10th place win it was tarnished with 5 blues in 2 races smh. mike and joe both got 3rds tonight i believe which is sick. chris needs to lock in.....

more kart soon! chip is slowly getting closer....
