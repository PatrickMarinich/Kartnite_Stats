Another MKM in the books. Interesting day today only one GP ended with a winner under 100 points, recently thats been the norm. 

5 GPs today, Pat took 2 Demitri took 2 and Kevin took 1. 

Mike took some blues today too pretty hype, Chris showed off his shroomless ultra cut which was awesome. 

Demitri may or may not have done a 3/3 double cut race, no footage so unsure....

anyways good plays, hyped for next week
