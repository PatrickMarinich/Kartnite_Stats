ANOTHER TUESDAY KART. its always scary when we miss monday. good plays by everybody tonight. mike had another look at a win needing a 1-3 on BC64 to get it done, unfortunetly it didnt go that way being a 1-4 the opposite way. 

RR had a 28 SECOND SHOCK and 3 of us dodged that was crazy thb

more kart soon
