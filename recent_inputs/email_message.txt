short kart session today in between the football games. Mike almost took 3rd over chris but rainbow road caused his downfall. 

Penn state won, Steelers lost, Ohio State won almost a sweep for teams i wanted to win. 

as for the stats, I redesigned the track MVP page, its 3 seperate pages now with more info then before, so check it out!
