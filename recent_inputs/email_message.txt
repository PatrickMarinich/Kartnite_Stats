This is take two, something broke...

Another Mario Kart Monday in the books. Good plays everybody it was great to chill tonight. Also shoutout mike for popping out again im hyped that hes coming to play with us.
no highscores or crazy comebacks to report today. however pat is 9/9 in the last 9 GPs and 11/12 in the past 12 that hes played (counting the loss to kevin and skipping one with karla in it). I think thats the longest streak to this point. 
does everybody know their longest winstreak? id like to make code for it but id probably have to just manually do it since weve lost some past races, but if people are interested I can do that. 

Good plays!
