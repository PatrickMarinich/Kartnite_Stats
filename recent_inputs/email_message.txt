after taking a week break MKM is BACK BABY. 5 solid GPs tonight, most in awhile. Demitri took 3 wins and Pat took 2, including a gross 95 point win on GP2

chris put up another donut, maybe he should start being the guy....

no close calls for mike this time, he did cause chris to crashout and sit gp5 though.

good plays, hyped for more kart soon!
