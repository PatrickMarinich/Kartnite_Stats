another successful merry kartnite in the books, as always, shout out to demitri for hosting.

we all won a GP, the rare EVEN split, kinda crazy (sorry mike). good plays by everybody. demitri with his first real win good job.

all the GPs were close today, should be some bangers in the pipeline on Mario Kart Monday.
