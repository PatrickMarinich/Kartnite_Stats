solid kart session as always. demitri coming in hot with 2 quick wins, kevin got 3 wins of his own and pat took 1 away. that means theres a new change at the top for total GP wins with kevin up by one. mike pulls out a third on the last GP of the day which was hype. chris well.... rip

the season is winding down, more comp soon
