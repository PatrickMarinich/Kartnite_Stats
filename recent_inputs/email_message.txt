comp is HEATING up after this mario kart monday. I sensed some TENSION tonight everybody was ON EDGE. Good plays overall I had a good time with the homies. 

Pat took 3 wins home today with kevin and demitri each getting one. Demitri was super close to a good score, a solid 109. 

The blue factory was OPEN today there were tons of those fellas on the race track this evening. 

good plays everybody, hyped for next week
