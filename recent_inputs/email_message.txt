Hey everybody, this round of the stats was automatically generated by the server that
I have been working on setting up over the past few weeks. Basically the current set up is I can input the 
stats from my phone and at 5am this script will run, if there are new stats to put in it will automatically input them
as well as send out the stats pdf. Hopefully this message gets to everybody! that would be a huge success for me. 

Let me know if this gets to you guys.

Thanks
-Pat (but actually his computer at 5am im still sleeping rn)
