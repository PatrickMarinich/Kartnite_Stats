For the first time all season (i think) theres a new GP leader, kevin is back on top. for now...

The GP scores today for the winners were HIGH all over 100, with a 114 by me on GP 1 to top out the day

Mike almost got his first 3rd, narrowly losing to chris by 1 point on the last race

were now under 2 months to go until the conclusion of the season, the grind continues

good plays everybody
