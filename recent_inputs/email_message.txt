The championship pdf is complete, I have split up the PDF into two, one for the stats and one for the events. All of the events from before will now be included in the new pdf. 

I decided to do this to de-clutter the stats pdf a little bit, to make the events easier to find, and to do some experimenting for the future with the inclusion of our time trials.

Thanks,
