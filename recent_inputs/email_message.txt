We skipped last week, but were so back with another MKM. Long Branch kart again was hype. 

another pop out from danny was pretty sick, hes getting pretty good, watch out kevin hes coming for you. 

mike almost gets his first GP win, got himself another 2nd place finish with a very strong look to win going into the 8th race

more kart soon!
